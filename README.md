## About

Multidimensional poverty analysis is crucial for understanding the complex factors contributing to poverty. This repository focuses on estimating and visualizing multidimensional poverty indicators using the Alkire-Foster Method Framework. Furthermore, it employs Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) to uncover spatial patterns and variations in poverty across regions.
