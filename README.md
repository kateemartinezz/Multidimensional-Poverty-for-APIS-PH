# Exploring Multidimensional Poverty

Exploring Multidimensional Poverty
This repository contains code and data for exploring multidimensional poverty using the Alkire-Foster Method Framework and employing Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) on the 2017 and 2019-2020 Annual Poverty Indicators Survey. The project aims to analyze and visualize poverty indicators, uncover spatial patterns, and provide insights into the multidimensional aspects of poverty for the specified survey years.

## About

Multidimensional poverty analysis is crucial for understanding the complex factors contributing to poverty. This repository focuses on estimating and visualizing multidimensional poverty indicators using the Alkire-Foster Method Framework. Furthermore, it employs Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) to uncover spatial patterns and variations in poverty across regions.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Microsoft Excel
- Required R libraries and R software
- GeoDa tools (for Spatial Regression)
- Gretl

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Follow the provided R scripts to run the analysis.
3. Explore the results, visualizations, and insights obtained from the poverty indicators.
